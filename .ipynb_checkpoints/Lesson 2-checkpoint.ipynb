This usually is for the purpose of establishing relationships between factors, and even can lead to establishing causality in between various factors. I will use data science in my career because I hope to be a 61A, and one of the most fundamental parts of this job will be focused on data collection, cleaning, and analysis."

    "High ice cream sales does not cause an increase in violent crime. This is an association, not a causal relationship. Associations can be established by mere observations, while much more evidence is necessary for a causal relationship. This is because a causal relationship needs proof of having eliminated confounding factors. In other words, We need to have eliminated the possibility that the dependent variable is a result of any external factor except for the one which we are studying."
